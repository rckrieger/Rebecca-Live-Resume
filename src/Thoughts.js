                To that end I thought I'd cover what I look for in a team/ role. As I'm a PM, I'll use the MoSCoW
                 prioritization model to structure it.</text>

                <ol>
                    <li>Laughter. Even if I work on a team that does serious work,
                        I still want to be able to laugh together over lunch</li>
                    <li>A great manager. I want a manager who is invested in helping employees achieve their long-term
                        career goals.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Work life balance. I don't mind occasional late meetings to work across time zones, but I don't
                        want to be in a culture where its expected you answer your emails through 7 pm</li>
                    <li>Office with either company shuttles or near public transit stops. I don't know how to drive.</li>

                    <li>Some degree of creative control. Product sense is one of my favorite parts of being a PM.</li>
                    <li>New product incubation. My greatest strength as a PM is brainstorming new ideas and creating
                        momentum for them.</li>
                    <li>In an ideal situation, I'd prefer to work from Seattle at least through Summer 2023
                        and then transition to the Bay or NY.</li>
                    <li>I'd like to work on a product I use. I understand its important to the user and yourself
                        separate, but I'd love to work on a product I use everyday.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Tiger-parent style management. Between my internships and full-time work, I've had roughly a
                    dozen managers, and this style has never worked for me.</li>
                    <li>A team with turnover >40%. My next move is culture-motivated. I want to work on a
                        team with a healthy culture.</li>
